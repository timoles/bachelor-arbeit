# BA Timo

# Goals

Meterpreter output in base64 encoded encrypted "viewstate"

## Debugging

Copy new dlls into metasploit directory
```
rm ~/Tools/bachelor_metasploit/metasploit-framework/data/meterpreter/*.dll; cp /mnt/hgfs/Shared_Folder/bachelor/vs_output/x64/* ~/Tools/bachelor_metasploit/metasploit-framework/data/meterpreter/; ./msfconsole -r ~/Projects/bachelor/msf.rc
```

Run metasploit auto create payload and start handlers
```bash
 ./msfconsole -r ~/Projects/bachelor/msf.rc 
```

Write .dll(s) into `/home/timo/Tools/bachelor_metasploit/metasploit-framework/data/meterpreter`
When creating payload it uses the ones in this directory first

# Goals

1. Make extension which gives back what it gets in methods

1. Make extension load before initial connection 

2. Compile and test LUA outside of meterpreter

# Compile extension

1. Follow this tutorial for the dll creation [Create extensions](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-payloads/tree/master/c/meterpreter#creating-extensions) but carefull, I had to copy a working extension because an error during linking (file not found) was thrown

# TODO UPDATE THIS LIST

2. Following files are most likely needed 
```bash
./data/meterpreter/ext_server_malleable.x64.dll # This one is our compiled dll which will be injected into meterpreter
./lib/rex/post/meterpreter/ui/console/command_dispatcher/malleable.rb # In here we define commands (in meterpreter session "help") and helptext we also call functions here (which are defined in the "extensions" directory). Also I think some UI cleanup/manage stuff

./lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/malleable/malleable.rb # # In here we implement the logic for the functions we can call through the UI. Also we send the actual requests to the server

./lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/malleable/tlv.rb # I think this has to do with obfuscating traffic. Data saved in TLV variables are obfuscated to some extend. TLV can be appended to Requests and sent out
```

2. Delete old meterpreter dll, copy new into metasploit directory, start msfconsole with resource file
```
rm /home/timo/Tools/bachelor/metasploit-framework/data/meterpreter/*.dll; cp /mnt/hgfs/Shared_Folder/bachelor/vs_output/x64/* /home/timo/Tools/bachelor/metasploit-framework/data/meterpreter/; ./msfconsole -r ~/Projects/bachelor/msf.rc
```

3. Check if generate function with extinit works

4. Check if loading function in metasploit works

5. Check if loading function works in meterpreter

# Ausblick

* Integrate event handling system in meterpreter where  we can hook specific functions (like in apache2). (e.g function systemcall or function sendOutgoingpackage) Queues with event priorities and so on

* What happens if extension is unloaded in the middle of beeing used, normaly then meterpreter connection would cut out. Would need backup transport for that

* "Real" usable web application with reverse proxy for extra stealth


# Notes

Meterpreter is always called the server and metasploit always called the client

Set log level in Metasploit `setg LogLevel 3`

Open all important client side files
```bash
subl ./lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/malleable/tlv.rb
subl ./lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/malleable/malleable.rb
subl ./lib/rex/post/meterpreter/ui/console/command_dispatcher/malleable.rb
``` 

# Options to handle the obfuscation problem

* DLL inject and overwrite sending functions (what about tlvs? Can we do this?)

* Create clone of http meterpreter (most likely least initial effort, but need to manually update in the future)

* Change original meterpreter code and make a check if extension is loaded

* Create own transport (Probably wrong place to change these things)

* is there a functionality which is checked called beforehand?

* ask OJreeves for an idea

# reverse proxy

Decisions: evilginx(1\|2) or openresty (vor nachteile usw....)

Decided for openresty
```
sudo docker build -t myopenresty -f bionic/Dockerfile .;sudo docker run -p80:80 -it myopenresty
```

# Problems

* Extint not working (preload extension before any communication)

* XOR key applied to packets, looks suspicious

* We cant use tlv functionality, to send the obfuscated packet we need to hook right before the packet send function

* elua for better performance, because LUA needs a while to close. (In BA write about multiple possibilities and why I've chosen LUA)

* Lua script error handling with automatic fallback 

* Get loaded commands/DLL/extensions

* Check advanced options in payload (e.g. allowdirectreverseProxy)

* SSL

* Stageless problems? especially with reverse proxy

* malicously crafted packets which will get parsed by lua

* which lua version has openresty and which one has meterpreter?

* Check how reverse proxy works back

* Slim LUA framework

* Free pointer in server_transport_winhttp.c

* Don't save lua file on system

* Is this filter needed?

* validate lua script

* lua script through string limited to xx thousand characters (under 20k ober 10k) (also formatting is shit)

* change in lua script "encrypt" to "encode"

* how to make c implementation of malleable as flexible as possible

* if we want to make real website we have to check how to differenciate inbetween meterpreter and normal user (filter it when encoding decondign in reverse proxy!) (mby header)

* Fix import slashes (/ and \\ )

* Add and use transport when malleable is loaded

* Deconstructor which deloads malleable 

* meterpreter st√ºrzt ab?

* how to implement lua libraries (from setscript or so)

* which lua version on openresty?

* upstream prematurely closed connection while reading response header from upstream,

* Lock until setstring is completed

* check if body nil in lua



# Bisherige Schritte

1. Basic functionality Extension zum laufen gebracht
2. Lua zum laufen gebracht
3. Reverse proxy aufgesetzt (openresty)
4. Integrated LUA dll into meterpreter
5. Make LUA take script string
